In this tutorial, we will explore some of the more advanced capabilities of OptTask, including:

* Multiobjective optimiation
* Changing predictors
    + Custom predictors
    + Built-in predictors
    + Acquisition functions for improving performance
    + Reducing prediction time
    + Customizing exploration
* Using z (extra) features

This tutorial is coming soon!


..  -- Use multiobjective with mixed dimensions
    -- Use custom predictor
    -- Results are bad
    -- Use builtin predictor
    -- Results are ok
    -- Use acquisition function
    -- Results are good

rocketsled is a flexible and automatic
`(open source) <https://github.com/hackingmaterials/rocketsled>`_ optimization
framework *"on rails"* for serious high throughput computation.

rocketsled is an extension of
`FireWorks <https://github.com/materialsproject/fireworks>`_ workflow software.


=====================
Is rocketsled for me?
=====================
Is your computational problem:

* Expensive and/or complex (requiring high performance computing + workflow software?)

* Run in high-throughput (many similar workflows running concurrently?)

* Limited by an allocation of CPU hours?

If you answered yes to these three questions, *keep reading!*

If you have a complex, multi-iteration task to execute on high performance
computers, and you would like to automatically reduce the number of expensive
calculations needed to run your task, **rocketsled is for you.**
